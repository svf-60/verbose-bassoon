## 📌 Expense Tracker
This project is a Python-based Expense Tracker that allows users to add, view, filter, calculate, and delete expenses. The program uses **Python dictionaries** to store expense data such as category, amount, and date. The project was developed collaboratively using GitHub.

## 🔧 Usage
Download from `releases`, and follow instructions from there...

> `expense_tracker.py` in `releases` has no in-line comments, check the main branch for in-line comments.

> Download `expense_tracker.py` in `main` branch, then run `python3 expense_tracker.py` (based on python installation) in terminal.

## 💭 Reflection

### Challenges Faced

- Managing merge conflicts when multiple members edited the same file

- Ensuring consistent variable naming across branches

- Handling invalid user input without crashing the program

### How We Overcame Them

- Used separate Git branches for each feature

- Reviewed pull requests carefully before merging

- Added try-except blocks for error handling

### Collaborative Coding Experience

We enjoyed collaborative coding because it allowed us to divide tasks efficiently and learn from each other. It was a new exprince and GitHub helped us collaboratie better and track changes clearly.
